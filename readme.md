# The Pan Card Tampering Detection App

# Introduction
In this project, we will detect tampering of PAN Card using computer vision. This project will help the different organization in detecting whether the ID's allocated (Pan cards, ID proofs, Aadhar) were tampered or not.

This helps to detect the fraudlent ID's that can disrupt the ethical and security issues of the organization.
